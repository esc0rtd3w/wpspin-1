ABOUT WPSPIN




The first version was released in crack-wifi.com, lampiweb.com and auditoriaswireless.net the 8th december 2012
It was published to reveal the results of my studies about Huawei HG 532c from ISP FTE (orange - Spanish branch)
I found the way to derivate the default WPSPIN from bssid and essid 
Surprisely a variant of the same algorithm ( but just bazed  on the mac adress ) worked on belkin device and another huawei router
I thought I found another algorithm, but i realized that it had been parallely and previously by zhaochunsheng in a C. script named computepinC83A35
( http://gjkiss.info/2012/04/get-the-pin-in-router-mac-address-start-with-c83a35-00b00c-081075 )
Later i integrated aracdyan easybox PIN generation has revealed by Stefan Viehb√∂ck ( https://www.sec-consult.com/fxdata/seccons/prod/temedia/advisories_txt/20130805-0_Vodafone_EasyBox_Default_WPS_PIN_Vulnerability_v10.txt )
and the WPA key genration for the same device thanks to a full disclosure of Stefan wottan ( http://www.wotan.cc/?p=6 )
finally i used VodafoneXXXX Arcadyan Essid  by coeman76 that unifie both and correct errors from original codes

Everything was adapted to bash from the scrach thanks to the collaboration of antares_145, r00tnuLL and 1camaron1, thanks to them billion a billion time :)

It wouldn't have been possible neither without my beloved lampiweb.com work crew, maripuri, bentosouto, dirneet, betis-jesus, compota, errboricobueno, pinty_102 nad all users 
greetings to crack-wifi.com familly, yasmine, M1ck3y, spawn, goliate, fuji, antares has been already credited, koala, noireaude, vances1, konik etc... and all users
greetings to auditoriaswireless.net and thanks to the big chief papones for the hosting and greetings to everybody
This code uses wps reaver that has to be installed on it own, reaver is a free software (http://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/) (GPL2) by Tactical Network Solutions. Thanks to 
them for this amazing work (especially Craig Heffner ) 
You also need aircrack-ng, thanks to Mister X and kevin devine for providing the best suite ever (http://www.aircrack-ng.org/)
Devlopped for debian bazed system such as Ubuntu, xubuntu, linux mint... and especially kali linux, tahnks to offensive security for theirs work and special grettings to g0tmi1k

- Unzip the package that you download
   < unzip WPSPIN >



- once situated in the created folder (cd WPSPIN) launch the script with
  < (sudo) bash WPSPIN.sh >


REQUIREMENTS

If you use WPSPIN as a simple generator no requierement. 

If you want to enjoy the scan and attack feature you need:

  - aircrack-ng and dependecies installed in your system
  - WPS reaver installed

you can visit crack-wifi.com, lampiweb.com and auditroias-wireless.net to get indormattion and help about WPSPIN and others issues like thiese ones
